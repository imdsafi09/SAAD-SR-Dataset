# SAAD-SR Dataset

This repository contains the official dataset and benchmark utilities for the paper:

**SAAD-SR: A Scale-Aware Aerial Benchmark for Learning Robust Object Representations Under UAV-Induced Scale Shifts**

SAAD-SR is designed to evaluate object detection robustness in aerial scenarios with altitude-induced scale variation and environmental diversity. The dataset includes:

- Discretized UAV telemetry (altitude-stratified views)
- Multi-condition image sequences (day, night, snow, haze)
- Altitude-specific annotations
- Per-class statistics
- Tools for image extraction, label generation, and human-in-the-loop correction

 Altitude-aware detection

 ## YOLOv8-SR: Altitude-Aware Detection Model

The YOLOv8-SR model is a customized version of YOLOv8 with scale-awareness built in via altitude conditioning. This is achieved by fusing altitude information with intermediate features in the detection head to bias predictions according to flight height.

Key features:

- Supports discrete altitude inputs (e.g., 15m, 25m, 45m)

-  Uses Altitude Embedding modules to influence scale-dependent layers

- Improves precision and recall on small objects at high altitudes

- Trained on SAAD-SR with fine-grained annotation consistency

### Steps to train the YOLOv8-SR model

1. Download the ultralytics-yolov8 from [source](https://github.com/ultralytics)
2. **Base framework adapted from [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics)**
3. Put all the scripts from YOLO-SR in the corresponding Ultralytics folders  
4. Run the script:

```bash
python3 YOLO-SR/train_YOLO_SR.py


```


##  Scale Robustness Index (SRI)


The Scale Robustness Index (SRI) is a novel metric introduced in SAAD-SR to quantify detection stability across altitude variations.

Definition:

SRI measures how consistently a model detects the same object across changes in altitude. Higher values imply better generalization across scale.

- SRI is computed per class and averaged across scenes

- Evaluates both prediction overlap and instance continuity

- Complements traditional metrics like mAP with altitude sensitivity

This metric enables fair comparison between altitude-aware and conventional detectors.
